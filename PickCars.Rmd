##My Application


I developed an application to help pick out the right car for you!

This presentation will describe my application!


## What car is right for you?

Here is my application: https://emily-medina.shinyapps.io/pickcars/

If you open it you will see you can pick several car characteristics and find the right car for you!

## What data did I use?

I used the pre-loaded data set in RStudio of mtcars. This contains data on 32 cars.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(datasets)
data(mtcars)
head(mtcars)

```

##Data exploration


```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(datasets)
data(mtcars)
cor(mtcars)

```
